# DevOps-360-Webapp
Webapp used in devops-360 project

## 1. Mysql Database
##### 1.1. Running the database in production

* Install a Mysql-Server
* Database schemas and the intial mysql dump are located in the [database](./database) folder.
* Developers will make sure to provide database schema upgrades in  `database/schemas/vX/beerbattle.sql` where `X` is the major realease number of the version. 

> For example [v1.0.0](https://github.com/Lowess/devops-360-webapp/releases/tag/v1.0.0) requires `database/schemas/v1/beerbattle.sql`.

> If you install [v2.0.0](https://github.com/Lowess/devops-360-webapp/releases/tag/v2.0.0) right away, you need to make sure to import the following schemas `database/schemas/v1/beerbattle.sql` and `database/schemas/v2/beerbattle.sql`.

> It is safe to rerun multiple times the schemas/vX/beerbattle.sql imports as they include `IF NOT EXISTS` statements.

* When you setup the database for the first time, you need to make sure to populate the `beer` table with the initial data dump file named [beerbattle.sql](./database/data/beerbattle.sql) (Also available as a CSV file if needed [beerbattle.csv](./database/data/beerbattle.csv)). 
 
> :warning: Do not run the data import twice otherwise you will end up with duplicated data!

## 2. Web application
##### 2.1. Running the application in production

* Install the project dependencies in a [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) with
```
cd <application-root>/
# Once the virtualenv is activated
pip install requirements.txt
```

* In order to override the developement configuration for production, configure the following template and place it under `<application-root>/app/config/prod.py`:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
 
from app.config.config import Config

class ProductionConfig(Config): 
   ### Mysql config
   MYSQL_SERVER = '127.0.0.1'
   MYSQL_DB = 'beerbattle'
   MYSQL_USER = 'root'
   MYSQL_PWD = 'password'

   ### Webapp custom settings
   # Restrict battles to a specific ID interval [min_id, max_id]
   # BEER_BATTLE_ID_INTERVAL = (1,10)
```

* Once the configuration is in place, make sure the following environment variable is set: `export FLASK_ENV=prod`.

* Now run `python run.py` and that's it :)

>Please note that in production you should not run `python run.py`. You should instead run the application with a tool like (UWSGI)[https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/]
